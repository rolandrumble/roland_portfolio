      <description>Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. The objective is to classify whether bank note is real or fake Using different Machine learning classification algorithms. Optimized Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifer and XGBoost using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.    Link to Github Repository</description>
